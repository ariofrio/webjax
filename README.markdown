MathJax for WeBWorK
===

This is a little userscript that adds [MathJax][] to [WeBWork][] using [the
MathJax CDN][cdn].  It (is supposed to) work correctly for questions, answer
previews, and even sidenotes ("Set Info").

  [webwork]: http://openwebwork.sf.net/
  [cdn]: http://www.mathjax.org/docs/1.1/start.html#mathjax-cdn

It has been tested only on some of [UCSB's WeBWorK][ucsb] installations, but
it should work in other installations too (please send me a patch report or
an e-mail if it doesn't). It also has only been tested in Google Chrome.
