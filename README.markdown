MathJax for WeBWorK
===

This is a little userscript that adds MathJax to WeBWork using MathJax's CDN.
It (is supposed to) work correctly for questions, answer previews, and even
sidenotes ("Set Info").

It has been tested only on some of [UCSB's WeBWorK][ucsb] installations, but
it should work in other installations too (please send me a patch report or
an e-mail if it doesn't). It also has only been tested in Google Chrome.
